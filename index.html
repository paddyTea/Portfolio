        <section>
            <p>I am a Sydney-based software developer. I have a particular interest in learning new ways to problem solve, especially when it comes to code, as there is a constant opportunity to learn and develop my skills. I am a recent graduate of Bachelors of Information Technology majoring in software technologies from Macquarie University and since then I have continued expanding my skillset through various courses on Coursera and Microsoft Learn. Technical Skills:- Java- Python- React- Flutter- HTML- CSS- C- GitHub- Git- MySQL- RESTful API'sMy passion for problem-solving expands to other domains of my life, including sewing and carpentry. Finding ways to be more invested and have a better understanding of the world around us. In doing so, I also find it very important to invest time daily into my physical and mental health by going to the gym. I can also be found at networking events throughout Sydney as I enjoy being an active part of the community. I am ready to find a team to grow with that values both the human and technical side of development. </p>
